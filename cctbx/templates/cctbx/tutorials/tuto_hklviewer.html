  <h2><center>HKLViewer tutorial</center></h2>

  <p class="lead mt-4">This tutorial shows some use cases of the HKLviewer.</p>

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

  <h3 class="mt-4">Display I/SigI of a dataset</h3>

  <p>
    Reflections with I/SigI &gt; 2 are considered to be good data for structure solution. Therefore, this cutoff is
    often used to determine the resolution limit. Here we examine a problematic dataset to show that for a given threshold
    of I/SigI a matching resolution cutoff does not necessarily exist.<br>
    Load the file <a href="https://phenix-online.org/phenix_data/cctbx_phenix_doc_data/merged.mtz">merged.mtz</a> in the
    HKLviewer. On the Details tab the IMEAN,SIGIMEAN reflections are shown by double clicking that label in the
    upper left table of datasets.
  </p>

  <img style="max-width: 90%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_01.png' %}">

  <p class="mt-3">
    By default, the colour mapping for each reflection is according to values of the intensity. The next
    section explains how to color according to I/sigI values.
  </p>

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

  <h3 class="mt-3">Computing I/SigI</h3>

  <p>
    Right click the row with the "IMEAN,SIGIMEAN" label and from the context menu select “Make a new dataset from
    this dataset and another dataset”.<br>
    In the “Create New Reflection data” dialog enter the lines of python code as given below into the textbox and “IoverSigI”
    as the formula and the label for the new data respectively.
  </p>

  <img style="max-width: 80%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_02.png' %}">

  <p class="mt-3">
    The first statement <code>newarray._data = flex.abs(array1.data())/array1.sigmas()</code> computes the
    I/SigI of all data values but with the absolute values of the intensities since there appear to be a significant number
    of negative intensities.<br>
    The <code>newarray</code> is always initialised to a copy of the original array (here representing "IMEAN,SIGIMEAN").<br>
    For I/SigI data we are not interested in the sigma values themselves. So we discard the sigmas array with the second
    statement <code>newarray._sigmas = None</code>.<br>
    The third statement <code>newarray.set_observation_type(None)</code> is optional.
    It tells CCTBX to deduce which type of data newarray will contain.
    In the case of I/SigI CCTBX will recognise the array as plain real numbers and the HKLviewer will then use a
    default colour coding for that. It could have been more specialised types
    such as map coefficients or X-ray observations. Had we left out this statement <code>newarray</code> would still
    have the observation type of intensities and use the corresponding colour coding.

    Since the colour mapping and sizing schemes are specific to each observation
    type, datasets classified with sensible observation types makes it easier to compare datasets in the viewer with other
    datasets of the same observation type.<br>
    Clicking the "Compute new reflection dataset" button will execute the script and display the IoverSigI dataset in the viewer
    as below
  </p>

  <p class="mt-3">
    The "Binning" Tab lets you choose the number of bins and the thresholds. By default data is binned
    according to resolution.
    But here we have binned against the newly created “IoverSigI” column and set the number of bins to 7.<br>
    HKLviewer will try to put an equal number of reflections into each bin and then compute corresponding bin thresholds.
    But for this exercise,
    we want the bin thresholds at defined I/SigI values: -100, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 1000.<br>
    Do this by entering these new bin thresholds by typing  the numbers 1000, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, and -100 in
    row 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 under the “lower bin value” column.<br>
    Then untick the "Opacity" checkboxes of the first three bins to hide reflections with I/SigI less than 2.
  </p>

  <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_04.png' %}">

  <p class="mt-3">
    The first column of the "Binning" shows the number of reflections in each bin. The relatively small total
    number of reflections with I/SigI > 2 means that it will be difficult to solve the structure for this data set.
  </p>

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

  <h3 class="mt-3">Creating a custom button on the Quick View tab that displays I/SigI>=2 </h3>
  Here we describe how the I/SigI>=2 buttons on the Quick View tab has been created. This also
  demonstrates how a dataset created on the fly can be accomplished with a customised button.
  Having followed the sections above and assuming we have not changed any settings of the HKLviewer
  we can now make a general custom button that will always display I/SigI>=2 for any dataset containing I/SigI values.
  Do this by bringing up the Settings (or Preferences) dialog from the File menu and extract the PHIL parameters
  as described  <a href="../doc_hklviewer/#get_PHIL_params">here</a>. This should produce the following text:

<pre><code>
Current non-default phil parameters:

miller_array_operation = "('newarray._data = array1.data()/array1.sigmas()\\nnewarray._sigmas = None', 'IoverSigI', ['IMEAN,SIGIMEAN', 'Intensity'], ['', ''])"
binning {
  scene_bin_thresholds = -100 0 1 2 3 4 30.8 1000
  binlabel = 'IoverSigI'
  bin_opacity = 0 0
  bin_opacity = 0 1
  bin_opacity = 0 2
  bin_opacity = 1 3
  bin_opacity = 1 4
  bin_opacity = 1 5
  bin_opacity = 1 6
  bin_opacity = 1 7
  bin_opacity = 1 8
  nbins = 7
}
viewer {
  data_array {
    label = "IoverSigI"
    datatype = "Intensity"
  }
}
</code></pre>

  The PHIL parameters below the line "Current non-default phil parameters:" should then be copied into a tuple element in
  the python list in the file,
  .hkl_viewer_buttons.py, that lives in the HOME directory as described <a href="../doc_hklviewer/#hkl_viewer_buttons_py_file">here</a>.
  The first two elements in the tuple should be a unique ID and an appropriate name such as "ISIGI2btn" and "I_SigI>=2",
  respectively. Next time the HKLviewer is started this button labelled "I_SigI>=2" will appear. This button will then
  be enabled for files containing datasets labelled 'IMEAN,SIGIMEAN' or, as a fallback, files with intensity datasets.


  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

  <h3 class="mt-3">Inspecting an unmerged dataset</h3>
  If you have unmerged intensity data in a loaded file this can be merged so that all reflections are cast into the same
  asymmetric unit wedge. The following unmerged data file
  <a href="https://phenix-online.org/phenix_data/cctbx_phenix_doc_data/merged.mtz">XDS_ASCII.HKL</a> suffered
  from problems during data collection but is nevetheless instructive to use in this tutorial.
  Load it into HKLviewer and click on the "Show Intensities" button on the Quick View tab. We note that a full sweep
  has not been performed during data collection.
  <br />
  <img style="max-width: 60%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_unmerged.png' %}">
  <br />
  This might be justified as the crystal has a high symmetry (I 41 2 2).
  Clicking the "Merged Intensities" button then merges the reflections
  into one asymmetric unit wedge.
  <br />
  <img style="max-width: 60%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_merged.png' %}">
  <br />

  Clicking the Multiplicities button calculates how many of the unmerged reflections
  have been used for deriving the value of each of the merged reflections.
  <br />
  <img style="max-width: 60%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_multi.png' %}">
  <br />
  With the multiplicities data it is then
  possible to sort reflections according to how many unmerged reflections they have been averaged over.


  <h3 class="mt-3">Inspecting TNCS modulation in a dataset</h3>

  <p>
    TNCS or pseudo-symmetry is a crystal pathology where two or more molecules in the unit cell are aligned in a way to
    cause interference in the diffraction pattern.
    It shows as periodic modulation of the diffraction pattern and can cause problems for structure solution unless
    identified and taken into
    account by the software. A TNCS vector is a real space vector and should be determined before structure solution attempts.
    <h5 class="mt-3">Using Xtriage to illustrate TNCS </h5>

    It is possible to visualise TNCS with Xtriage if the modulation is strong. HKLviewer makes this visible by computing
    normalised amplitudes (E-values) and aligning an expanded sphere of reflections with the TNCS vector emitted by
    Xtriage parallel or perpendicular to the screen. The coordinates for the TNCS vector detected by Xtriage is given in
    the Xtriage log file and it is also added as a vector on the Vectors tab on the Details tab.

    The dataset <a href="https://files.rcsb.org/download/3RBX-sf.cif">3RBX</a> has strong
    TNCS modulation which can be detected by <code>Xtriage</code>. After downloading the data convert it to mtz
    with the command <code>iotbx.cif_as_mtz 3RBX-sf.cif</code> which will produce an mtz file named <code>3RBX-sf.mtz</code>.
    Then follow the steps below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open <code>3RBX-sf.mtz</code> in the HKLviewer.</li>
    <li>On the Quick View tab, click on the "Show Intensities" button to display the data.</li>
    <li>Click on the "Run Xtriage" button and wait a moment until Xtriage has finished.</li>
    <li>
      Click on the <a href="../doc_hklviewer/#Xtriage">"Rotate around "TNCS_xtriage vector"</a> button.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The TNCS vector now points upwards parallel to the screen as a dark line emerging from the origin of the
    reciprocal lattice. In this case the modulation is seen as strong E-values every third layer of reflections
    in reciprocal space indicating that there are three aligned molecules in the asymmetric unitcell giving rise to the
    TNCS.

  </p>

  <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_xtriageTNCS.png' %}">

  <h5 class="mt-3">Using Xtricorder to illustrate TNCS </h5>

  <p>
    If the modulation is weak or mostly confined to low resolution reflections then it is not easy to confirm
    TNCS through visual inspection of E-values. However, the TNCS correction terms produced by Xtricorder in the TEPS
    column still makes this possible. The coordinates for the TNCS vector emitted by Xtricorder is in the 
    header of the mtz file produced by Xtricorder. It is then listed on the
    <a href="../doc_hklviewer/#vectors_tab">vectors tab</a> and as the
    buttons on the Quick View tab described <a href="../doc_hklviewer/#Xtricorder">here</a> named "Rotate around TNCS vector"
    and "Slice perpendicular to TNCS vector".
    <br />The data file <a href="https://edmaps.rcsb.org/coefficients/3syp.mtz">3syp_phases.mtz</a> serves as an illustration.
    <ul>
      <li>Open <code>3syp_phases.mtz</code> in the HKLviewer.</li>
      <li>On the Quick View tab, "Run Xtricorder" button and wait a moment until Xtricorder has finished.</li>
      <li>
        Click on the <a href="../doc_hklviewer/#Xtricorder">"Rotate around "TNCS_xtricorder vector"</a> button.
      </li>
    </ul>
    We note that the modulation is confined to the low resolution part of reflections.


    <br />
    Pressing the button on the Quick View tab labelled "Rotate around TNCS vector" will then slice the reflections
    with a clip plane width of around 8 units, expand all reflections to P1 and Friedel mates, align the reflections
    with the TNCS vector parallel to the screen, pointing upwards and rotate the sphere of reflections around the TNCS
    vector. This will show the TNCS modulation as coloured horizontal ripples in the sphere of reflections.
    <br />
    <img style="max-width: 80%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_xtricorderTNCS.png' %}">
    <br />

    We can also illustrate the modulation by pressing the "Slice perpendicular to TNCS_xtricorder vector" button.
    Thereby we can
    inspect the modulation layer by layer. We expect every other slice of reflections to have a
    strong or weak TNCS correction factor. This is frequently less obvious as the TNCS vector typically
    is not completely parallel with a reciprocal space vector with
    integer indices. Therefore a mixture of strong and weak reflections may be present in each slice.
    In the current example there are about 68 TNCS modulation layers alternating between weak and strong reflections.
    <br />

    Layer of strong reflections.

    <img style="max-width: 50%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_xtricorderTNCS_layer2.png' %}">
    Layer of weak reflections.
    <br />
    The "+" and "-" buttons makes it easy to step through each layer of reflections perpendicular to the
    TNCS vector.
  </p>
  We could also have used Xtriage to detect TNCS but for this dataset the TNCS modulation is not strong enough
  to be easily noticed visually from E-values.

  <a name="inspecting_a_twin_law"></a>
  <h3 class="mt-4">Inspecting a twin law</h3>

  <p>
    The phenix tutorial with the file,
    <a href="https://phenix-online.org/phenix_data/cctbx_phenix_doc_data/porin.mtz">porin.mtz</a>, illustrates twinning.
    Follow the steps below:
    <ul>
      <li>Load the file in the HKLviewer and display the dataset “F-obs,SIGF-obs”.</li>
      <li>Click on the "Run Xtriage" button and wait a moment until Xtriage has finished.</li>
      <li>
        Click on the <a href="../doc_hklviewer/#Xtriage">"Slice amplitudes perpendicular to twin axis"</a> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compare the list of twin operators in Xtriage log at the bottom with the list of twin operators present on
        the vectors tab.
        <img style="max-width: 90%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_twinning1.png' %}">
      </li>
      <li>
        On the drop down list of twin operators
        we select the twin operator with the lowest R-value. This is the operator h,-h-k,-l labelled "2-fold_twin_6".
        <img style="max-width: 90%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_twinning2.png' %}">
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">
    To inspect data values of reflections related by the twin operator right-click a reflection in the view.
    It will bring up two tooltips with the hkl indices at the end of two vectors from the reciprocal space origin pointing to
    the twin reflections. Due to the clip plane, the vectors may not be fully visible. Double click one of the reflections
    to bring up the standard tooltip with all other values represented by this reflection (dres, F-obs, SIGF-obs, R-free-flags).
    Bring up the table of data values of the "F-obs,SIGF-obs" dataset by right-clicking it in the table of
    <a href="../doc_hklviewer/#show_table_of_datasets">datasets on the details tab</a>.

    Right-clicking a reflection will then highlight the data value in the “Tabulated Reflection data” window. The HKL indices in the
    table are the original from file. Since the twin operator is not part of the spacegroup the hkl index in the tooltip of a
    twin related reflection may differ from the HKL index generated by P1 or Friedel mates expansion highlighted in the
    Tabulated Reflection Data.
  </p>
  <img style="max-width: 90%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_twinning3.png' %}">
<br />  
As in the example above with a TNCS vector perpendicular to the screen the "+" and "-" buttons 
  makes it easy to step through layer of reflections perpendicular to the twin axis.

  <a name="inspecting_information_content"></a>
  <h3 class="mt-4">Inspecting information content in reflections with I/SigI&lt;0.5</h3>
  The data file <a href="https://files.rcsb.org/download/6HUF-sf.cif">6HUF-sf.cif</a> is useful for illustrating
  that sometimes reflections can have very small I/SigI values but still be of use for structure solution software.
  Convert it to mtz format with the command <code>iotbx.cif_as_mtz 6HUF-sf.cif</code>. Then
  <ul>
    <li>
      Load the file 6HUF-sf.mtz in the HKLviewer and click "Run Xtricorder" on the Quick View tab and wait a moment
      until it has finished.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the "I/SigI>=2" button on the Quick View tab. This will generate an additional dataset of
      I/SigI values labelled "IoverSigI ".
    </li>
    <li>On the Details tab find the INFO dataset in the table of datasets and then right-click it to bring up the context menu.</li>
    <li>Select the "Make new dataset from this dataset and another datasset" menu item.</li>
    <li>
      In the new dataset dialog fill out the dialog box with the line
      <code>newarray=array1.select(array2.data()<0.5)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Select the "IoverSigI" dataset in the dropdown list to represent <code>array2</code>.</li>
    <li>Give the column label the name "Info_ISigI_0.5" and press the "Compute new reflection dataset" button</li>
  </ul>
  <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_INFO.png' %}">
  <br />
  This will generate and display a new dataset labelled "Info_ISigI_0.5" of INFO values for reflections that
  have I/SigI&lt;0.5. There are only about 9000 reflections.
  To see which of those have INFO values larger than 0.2 bits go to the Binning tab:
  <ul>
    <li>Select INFO from the drop down list to bin the "Info_ISigI_0.5" dataset according to INFO values.</li>
    <li>Set the number of bins to 3 or larger.</li>
    <li>Enter 0.2 as the lower bin value in the second row.</li>
    <li>Deselect the first bin by un-ticking the checkbox to the right.</li>
  </ul>
  <img style="max-width: 70%;" src="{% static 'cctbx/img/tutorials/tuto_hklviewer_INFO2.png' %}">
  <br />
  This will then display only those reflections with more than 0.2 bits information content but with I/SigI&lt;0.5.
  As we see this is more than 6000 reflections or almost 10 percent of the dataset. This is a significant number
  of reflections. Omitting such a large number of reflections could adversely impact solving the structure.
  <br />
