<h2 class="mt-4"><center>cctbx - Computational Crystallography Toolbox</center></h2>

<p class="mt-4">The <a href="https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project">Computational Crystallography Toolbox</a> (cctbx) is an open-source library of reusable software components for macromolecular structure determination (<a href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?ks0118">Grosse-Kunstleve et al., 2002</a>. The cctbx components are written both in C++ (a compiled language) and Python (a flexible scripting language. This approach is very efficient because high-level algorithms (such as refinement protocols) can be rapidly developed in Python, while computationally intensive algorithms can be implemented in C++. The <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost.Python Library</a> is used to expose the C++ interfaces, classes and functions to Python (Abrahams & Grosse-Kunstleve, 2003).<br>
The cctbx is released under an Open Source license to allow unrestricted use and continued development</p>

<h2 class="mt-5"><center>What the cctbx can do for you</center></h2>

<p class="mt-4">The cctbx has many modules that are specifically developped for applications in structural biology: crystallography and cryo-EM. For example, the cctbx contains algorithms for the handling of unit cells, space groups and atomic scatterers.<br>
The cctbx can used to develop new algorithms for structural biology. It also allows easy scripting of basic tasks.</p>
