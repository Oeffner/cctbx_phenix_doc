<h2><center>Install and set up Phenix</center></h2>

<p class="lead mt-4">A prerequisite of using Phenix modules is to install Phenix.</p>

<p>Before you start you will need to install and set up Phenix so that when you type the command  <code>phenix.python</code> in a terminal window on your computer you get something like this:</p>

<pre class="CodeGreen" style="font-size: 12px"><code>Python 2.7.15 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar  5 2020, 14:58:04)
[GCC Clang 9.0.1 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>></code></pre>

<p>The <code>>>></code> is the command prompt that means “type something here”.</p>

<p>When you have Phenix installed, you automatically get tutorial, testing, and demo data files that come with Phenix. We’ll use some of those in this tutorial. Some of these will be in the directory:</p>

<pre class="CodeGreen" style="font-size: 12px"><code>$PHENIX/modules/phenix_regression/model_building/</code></pre>

</p>which contains tests for model-building tools.</p>
